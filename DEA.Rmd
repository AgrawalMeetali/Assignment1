## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library("lpSolveAPI")
x <- read.lp("DEA1.lp")
x
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
solve(x)
get.objective(x)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
get.variables(x)
```

```{r}
library(Benchmarking)
```

```{r}
x <- matrix(c(100,100,100,100,100))
y <- matrix(c(10,15,20,23,30,31,25,30,23,20),ncol = 2)

colnames(y) <- c("loans","deposits")
y
```

```{r}
d <- dea(x,y,RTS = "crs")
d
peers(d)
lambda(d)
```

```{r}
dea.plot(x,y,RTS = "vrs")
```
